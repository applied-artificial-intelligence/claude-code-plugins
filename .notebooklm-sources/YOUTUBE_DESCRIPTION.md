From Chaos to System: Structured AI Development Workflows

Tired of hitting context limits mid-task? Losing your project context when switching features? Wish your AI coding assistant could actually remember your decisions and patterns?

This video introduces Claude Code Plugins - a production-ready framework that transforms AI-assisted development from chaotic conversations into structured, repeatable workflows.

üéØ WHAT YOU'LL LEARN

‚Ä¢ The core problem with AI-assisted coding (context limits, knowledge loss, inconsistent quality)
‚Ä¢ How structured workflows solve these issues
‚Ä¢ The explore ‚Üí plan ‚Üí next ‚Üí ship methodology
‚Ä¢ Memory management for persistent project knowledge
‚Ä¢ Real examples from 6+ months of production use

‚ö° KEY FEATURES

‚úÖ 30+ Commands across 5 core plugins (workflow, development, git, memory, core)
‚úÖ Persistent memory that survives session boundaries
‚úÖ Quality automation with safe git commits and validation gates
‚úÖ MCP integration (Serena, Sequential Thinking, Context7)
‚úÖ Battle-tested on 500+ page books, quantitative research, full-stack apps

üì¶ WHAT'S INCLUDED

‚Ä¢ Core Plugin: System commands (status, work, config, cleanup, index)
