## Next Steps

### If Continuing Week 4:
Run `/next` to start TASK 4.1 (Create RepoMix packages)

### If Pivoting:
Specify new priority or use case, and we'll adapt the plan

### If Taking a Break:
Repository is in excellent state for:
- Private beta testing
- Limited sharing with trusted users
- Internal team usage

All work is committed and documented for easy resume.
