# Code Review

Standard code review focused on practical code quality issues: bugs, design flaws, dead code, and maintainability. Always provides a prioritized action plan for improvements.

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Usage

### Standard Code Review (Default)
```bash
/review                    # Review entire project for code quality issues
/review src/auth.py        # Review specific file
/review src/components/    # Review specific directory
```

### Requirements Validation
```bash
/review --spec design.md   # Validate code against requirements document
/review --spec @requirements.md  # Validate against specific requirements
```

### Systematic Review (Complex Projects)
```bash
/review --systematic       # Use structured reasoning for complex codebases
/review src/ --systematic  # Systematic review of specific area
```

### Semantic Review (With Serena)
```bash
/review --semantic         # Use Serena for semantic analysis (70-90% token reduction)
/review src/ --semantic    # Semantic review of specific directory
/review --semantic --spec design.md  # Combine semantic analysis with requirements
```

## What This Review Covers

### ‚úÖ Standard Code Review Focus
1. **Bug Detection**: Logic errors, edge cases, error handling issues
2. **Design Flaws**: Code organization, coupling, cohesion problems
3. **Dead Code**: Unused functions, imports, variables, commented code
4. **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, consistency
5. **Performance Issues**: Obvious inefficiencies and bottlenecks
6. **Best Practices**: Language-specific patterns and conventions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's NOT Included (By Design)
- **Security Scanning**: No longer the default focus - use specialized security tools if needed
- **Infrastructure Audits**: Use `/audit` command for framework and infrastructure validation
- **Documentation Validation**: Handled by specialized documentation commands

## Phase 1: Determine Review Scope

Parse the arguments to determine what to review and which mode to use:

- **Target**: `$ARGUMENTS` (file or directory to review)
- **--spec [file]**: Validate against requirements document
- **--systematic**: Use structured reasoning for complex analysis

If reviewing a large codebase (>30 files), consider using semantic analysis tools if available (like Serena MCP) for more efficient symbol analysis and dependency tracking.

## Phase 2: Requirements Validation (If Specified)

```bash
if [ -n "$REQUIREMENTS_FILE" ]; then
    echo "üìñ Loading requirements specification..."

    # Handle @file syntax
    SPEC_FILE="$REQUIREMENTS_FILE"
    if [[ "$REQUIREMENTS_FILE" == @* ]]; then
        SPEC_FILE="${REQUIREMENTS_FILE#@}"
    fi

    if [ ! -f "$SPEC_FILE" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå Requirements file not found: $SPEC_FILE"
        echo "Please ensure the specification file exists."
        exit 1
    fi

    echo "‚úÖ Requirements loaded from: $SPEC_FILE"
    echo ""
fi
```

## Phase 3: Execute Code Review

Perform the code review using appropriate methods:

**If semantic analysis tools are available** (e.g., Serena MCP):
- Use symbol-aware analysis for dead code detection
- Trace function dependencies and call graphs
- Identify circular dependencies and design patterns
- This can reduce token usage by 70-90% for large codebases

**Task Parameters for Code-Reviewer Agent**:
- **subagent_type**: code-reviewer
- **description**: Standard code review focused on practical issues
- **prompt**: Perform a code review of `$REVIEW_TARGET` focusing on:

  **Primary Focus Areas**:
  1. **Bug Detection and Logic Issues**:
     - Logic errors and edge cases
     - Error handling gaps and exception safety
     - Null pointer issues and bounds checking
     - Race conditions and concurrency issues
     - Input validation problems

  2. **Design and Architecture Issues**:
     - Code organization and structure problems
     - Tight coupling and low cohesion
     - Violation of SOLID principles
     - Missing abstractions or over-engineering
     - Inconsistent patterns and conventions

  3. **Dead Code and Cleanup**:
     - Unused functions, classes, and variables
     - Unreachable code paths
     - Commented-out code blocks
     - Unused imports and dependencies
     - Obsolete TODOs and FIXME comments

  4. **Code Quality and Maintainability**:
     - Readability and clarity issues
     - Complex functions that need refactoring
     - Magic numbers and hardcoded values
     - Naming conventions and clarity
     - Documentation gaps for complex logic

  5. **Performance Observations**:
     - Obvious inefficiencies (N+1 queries, unnecessary loops)
     - Memory usage issues
     - Algorithmic improvements
     - Resource leak potential

$([ -n "$REQUIREMENTS_FILE" ] && echo "
  6. **Requirements Compliance**:
     - Validate implementation against requirements in $SPEC_FILE
     - Check for missing functionality
     - Verify acceptance criteria are met
     - Identify gaps between spec and implementation")

  **Output Requirements**:
  - **Focus on practical issues**: Bugs, design flaws, maintainability
  - **No security emphasis**: Skip security scanning unless critical
  - **Prioritized action plan**: High/Medium/Low priority issues
  - **Specific recommendations**: Concrete steps to fix each issue
  - **Code examples**: Show specific problematic code when possible

### Systematic Review (Complex Projects)

When systematic review is requested, use structured reasoning:

```bash
if [ "$USE_SYSTEMATIC" = "true" ]; then
    echo "üß† Performing systematic code review with structured reasoning..."
    echo ""
fi
```

Use Sequential Thinking MCP for comprehensive analysis:

**Sequential Thinking Parameters**:
- **Initial thoughts**: 15-20 for comprehensive systematic review
- **Focus**: Step-by-step code quality analysis across multiple dimensions
- **Process**: Systematic evaluation of bugs, design, maintainability

**Systematic Review Process**:
1. **Codebase Overview**: Understand project structure and patterns
2. **Bug Analysis**: Systematic search for logic errors and edge cases
3. **Design Evaluation**: Assess architecture and organization
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate readability and maintainability
5. **Performance Review**: Identify obvious inefficiencies
6. **Best Practices Check**: Verify adherence to conventions
7. **Prioritization**: Rank issues by impact and effort to fix
8. **Action Plan Generation**: Create specific, actionable recommendations

## Phase 4: Generate Prioritized Action Plan

All reviews must include a structured action plan:

```bash
echo ""
echo "üìã Generating prioritized action plan..."
echo ""
```

The code-reviewer agent will provide output in this format:

```markdown
# Code Review Results

## Estimated Effort
- Critical fixes: X hours
- Important improvements: Y hours
- Minor cleanups: Z hours
- **Total estimated effort**: N hours
```

## Phase 5: Save Review Results

```bash
# Save review results for tracking and follow-up
echo "üíæ Saving review results..."

# Determine save location
REVIEW_FILE=""
if [ -n "$WORK_UNIT_DIR" ] && [ -d "$WORK_UNIT_DIR" ]; then
    # Save in work unit if available
    REVIEW_FILE="$WORK_UNIT_DIR/review_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).md"
    echo "üìÇ Saving in active work unit: $(basename "$WORK_UNIT_DIR")"
else
    # Save in .claude directory
    mkdir -p .claude/reviews
    REVIEW_FILE=".claude/reviews/review_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).md"
    echo "üìÇ Saving in .claude/reviews/"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Review saved: $REVIEW_FILE"
echo ""
echo "üí° Next steps:"
echo "   - Review the prioritized action plan"
echo "   - Use /fix to apply recommended fixes"
echo "   - Run /review again after fixes to verify improvements"
```

## Success Indicators

A successful code review includes:

- ‚úÖ **Practical Focus**: Bugs, design issues, dead code identified
- ‚úÖ **No Security Emphasis**: Focus on code quality, not security scanning
- ‚úÖ **Prioritized Action Plan**: Critical/Important/Minor classification
- ‚úÖ **Specific Recommendations**: Concrete steps to fix each issue
- ‚úÖ **Effort Estimates**: Time required for fixes
- ‚úÖ **Clear Output**: Easy to understand and act upon

## Integration with Fix Command

After review, apply fixes with:

```bash
/fix review                    # Apply fixes from most recent review
/fix .claude/reviews/review_*.md  # Apply fixes from specific review
```

The `/fix` command can automatically apply many of the recommended improvements.
