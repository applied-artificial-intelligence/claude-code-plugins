# Unified Work Management

Comprehensive work unit management with subcommands for continuing work, saving checkpoints, switching contexts, and viewing status.

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

## Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Standard constants (must be copied to each command)
readonly CLAUDE_DIR=".claude"
readonly WORK_DIR="${CLAUDE_DIR}/work"
readonly WORK_CURRENT="${WORK_DIR}/current"
readonly WORK_COMPLETED="${WORK_DIR}/completed"

# Error handling functions (must be copied to each command)
error_exit() {
    echo "ERROR: $1" >&2
    exit 1
}

warn() {
    echo "WARNING: $1" >&2
}

debug() {
    [ "${DEBUG:-false}" = "true" ] && echo "DEBUG: $1" >&2
}

# Safe directory creation
safe_mkdir() {
    local dir="$1"
    mkdir -p "$dir" || error_exit "Failed to create directory: $dir"
}

# Parse arguments
ARGUMENTS="$ARGUMENTS"
SUBCOMMAND=""
FILTER="all"
WORK_ID=""
MESSAGE=""

# Extract subcommand or filter

            echo "✅ Switched to work unit: ${WORK_ID}"
            ;;
    esac
fi
```

## Usage Examples

```bash
/work                    # List all work units (default)
/work active             # List only active work units
/work continue          # Resume last active work unit
/work continue 002      # Resume specific work unit
/work checkpoint        # Save current progress
/work checkpoint "Major milestone reached"  # Save with custom message
/work switch 003        # Switch to work unit 003
```

## Detailed Operation Phases

### Phase 1: Determine Work Operation

Based on the arguments provided: $ARGUMENTS

I'll determine which work management operation to perform:

- **List Operations**: No subcommand or filter keyword - show work unit list
- **Continue Operations**: Arguments start with "continue" - resume work
- **Checkpoint Operations**: Arguments start with "checkpoint" - save progress
- **Switch Operations**: Arguments start with "switch" - change active work unit

## Phase 2: Execute Work Unit Listing

When listing work units:

### Work Unit Discovery
1. **Scan Work Directory**: Examine `.claude/work/current/` for active work units
2. **Parse Metadata**: Read metadata.json files to understand work unit status
3. **Identify Active Unit**: Check `ACTIVE_WORK` file for currently active work
4. **Status Analysis**: Determine work unit phases and progress

### Filtering Options
- **All Units** (default): Show all work units regardless of status
- **Active Units**: Only show units in active development
- **Paused Units**: Show units that are paused but not completed
- **Completed Units**: Display archived and completed work units

### Work Unit Display Format
```
📋 WORK UNITS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🟢 001_auth_system        [implementing]     3/5 tasks  (60%)
   ↳ Last: 2 hours ago - TASK-003 in progress

⏸️  002_payment_flow      [paused]          1/4 tasks  (25%)
   ↳ Last: 1 day ago - waiting for API specs

✅ 003_user_dashboard     [completed]       4/4 tasks  (100%)
   ↳ Completed: 3 days ago - shipped to production

📝 004_notification_sys   [planning]        0/6 tasks  (0%)
   ↳ Last: 30 minutes ago - plan in progress
```

## Phase 3: Execute Continue Operations

When continuing work:

### Resume Active Work Unit
1. **Identify Target**: Determine which work unit to resume (last active or specified)
2. **Load Context**: Read work unit metadata, state, and progress
3. **Validate State**: Ensure work unit is in resumable state
4. **Set Active**: Mark work unit as active and update session context
5. **Display Status**: Show current task and next actions

### Context Restoration
1. **Work Unit Activation**: Set as active work unit in `ACTIVE_WORK`
2. **Session Memory**: Load work unit context into session memory
3. **Task Context**: Identify current task and next available tasks
4. **Environment Setup**: Prepare development environment for continued work

### Continue Options
- **Continue Latest**: Resume most recently active work unit
- **Continue Specific**: Resume explicitly specified work unit by ID
- **Continue with Validation**: Verify work unit state before resuming

## Phase 4: Execute Checkpoint Operations

When creating checkpoints:

### Progress Capture
1. **Current State**: Capture current task progress and completion status
2. **Work Summary**: Document work completed since last checkpoint
3. **Context Preservation**: Save current development context and environment
4. **Timestamp Recording**: Record checkpoint creation time and duration

### Checkpoint Documentation
1. **Progress Summary**: What has been accomplished since last checkpoint
2. **Current Status**: What task is in progress and next steps
3. **Issues Encountered**: Any blockers or challenges discovered
4. **Next Session Prep**: What needs to be done to resume work

### Checkpoint Types
- **Automatic Checkpoints**: Created at natural stopping points
- **Manual Checkpoints**: Created with custom messages and context
- **Session Checkpoints**: Created when switching between work units
- **Milestone Checkpoints**: Created at major completion points

## Phase 5: Execute Switch Operations

When switching work units:

### Pre-Switch Validation
1. **Current Work Status**: Check if current work should be checkpointed
2. **Target Validation**: Verify target work unit exists and is accessible
3. **Conflict Detection**: Identify any conflicts between work units
4. **Safety Checks**: Ensure switching won't lose important work

### Context Switching
1. **Save Current Context**: Checkpoint current work unit if needed
2. **Load Target Context**: Load target work unit metadata and state
3. **Update Active Work**: Set new work unit as active
4. **Environment Update**: Adjust development environment for new context

### Switch Safety
- **Automatic Checkpointing**: Save current progress before switching
- **Work Validation**: Ensure target work unit is in valid state
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle conflicts between work units
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to return to previous work unit

## Phase 6: Work Unit Health Monitoring

### Health Checks
1. **Metadata Integrity**: Validate all work unit metadata files
2. **State Consistency**: Ensure task states are logically consistent
3. **File Organization**: Verify work unit directory structure
4. **Progress Tracking**: Validate progress calculations and dependencies

### Maintenance Operations
1. **Cleanup Stale Units**: Identify and clean up abandoned work units
2. **Archive Completed**: Move completed work units to archive
3. **Repair Corruption**: Fix any corrupted metadata or state files
4. **Optimize Storage**: Compress and optimize work unit storage

## Success Indicators

### Listing Operations
- ✅ All work units discovered and categorized
- ✅ Current status accurately displayed
- ✅ Progress information up to date
- ✅ Clear visual organization

### Continue Operations
- ✅ Work unit successfully resumed
- ✅ Context properly restored
- ✅ Current task clearly identified
- ✅ Ready for `/next` execution

### Checkpoint Operations
- ✅ Progress safely captured
- ✅ Context preserved for resumption
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Checkpoint successfully created

### Switch Operations
- ✅ Previous work safely saved
- ✅ New work unit activated
- ✅ Context successfully switched
- ✅ Environment properly configured

## Integration with Workflow

- **Explore Integration**: New work units created by `/explore` appear in listings
- **Planning Integration**: Work units show planning progress and completion
- **Execution Integration**: Task progress updates reflected in work unit status
- **Shipping Integration**: Completed work units marked and archived

## Examples

### List Active Work
```bash
/work active
# → Shows only work units currently in development
```

### Resume Last Work
```bash
/work continue
# → Resumes most recently active work unit
```

### Save Progress Checkpoint
```bash
/work checkpoint "Completed authentication module"
# → Saves current progress with descriptive message
```

### Switch Between Projects
```bash
/work switch 003
# → Switches to work unit 003, checkpointing current work
```
