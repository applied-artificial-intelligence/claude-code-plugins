- Comprehensive utility documentation in `src/utils/README.md` (650+ lines)
- Build system design in `docs/development/build-system.md`
- Implementation deferred to post-launch (utilities stable, ~1-2 changes/year)

### Changed

#### Plugin Structure
- **BREAKING**: Removed `core` plugin (bloated, 14 mixed commands)
- **BREAKING**: Replaced with 2 focused plugins (`system`, `agents`)
- Commands redistributed to 6 focused plugins by purpose
- No command behavior changes (pure reorganization)
- All command names unchanged

#### Dependencies
- **workflow** plugin: Dependency changed from `claude-code-core` to `claude-code-system`
- **development** plugin: Dependency changed from `claude-code-core` to `claude-code-system`

#### Plugin Manifests
- Updated `plugin.json` for workflow, memory, development, system, agents
- Added capabilities for new commands in each plugin
- Updated keywords to reflect expanded command scope
- All plugins now accurately describe their purpose

### Fixed

- **Major Issue #1**: Utility code duplication (94% reduction: ~1,320 lines â†’ 86 lines)
  - Created single source of truth in `src/utils/common.sh`
  - Comprehensive documentation with usage examples
  - Deferred build system implementation (complexity > benefit)
- **Major Issue #2**: Bloated core plugin (addressed via reorganization)
  - Replaced 1 generic plugin with 6 focused plugins
  - Clear separation of concerns (system, workflow, agents, memory)
  - Improved discoverability and plugin descriptions

### Deprecated
