## Template A: Technical Reviewer Invitation

**Subject**: Technical review invitation: Claude Code plugin ecosystem [Your expertise needed]

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I hope this message finds you well! I'm reaching out because of your expertise in [specific area - e.g., "plugin architectures" / "developer tooling" / "CLI design"].

I'm launching **claude-code-plugins**, an open-source plugin marketplace for Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant). Before the public launch, I'm seeking technical feedback from a small group of experienced engineers.

**Why your feedback matters:**
Your background in [specific expertise] makes you ideal to evaluate:
- Plugin architecture and extensibility patterns
- Code quality and maintainability
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Technical documentation clarity

**What I'm asking:**
- **Time**: 3-4 hours over the next 2 weeks
- **Package**: Two review packages (documentation + full source code)
- **Focus**: Architecture, design patterns, code quality
- **Output**: Written feedback via GitHub discussion or document

**What you'll get:**
- Early access to a growing plugin ecosystem
- Recognition as a technical reviewer (if desired)
- Potential collaboration on future development
- My eternal gratitude üôè

**Review materials:**
I've prepared a comprehensive package specifically for technical reviewers:
- Documentation Package (~91K tokens): Complete architecture docs, design principles
- Developer Package (~210K tokens): Full source code for 5 plugins, 30 commands, 5 agents

**Next steps:**
If you're interested, I'll send you:
1. The review packages (Markdown format, AI-friendly)
2. A feedback template with specific questions
3. Access to a private GitHub discussion for questions

No pressure if you're too busy - I know your time is valuable. Either way, I'd appreciate knowing whether this might be of interest.

Thanks for considering!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. The packages are formatted in Markdown and optimized for AI consumption - you can load them into Claude or your preferred LLM for faster analysis if you'd like.
