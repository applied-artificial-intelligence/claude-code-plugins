## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Getting Quality Analysis from LLMs

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Read the LLM's analysis carefully before submitting
- Ask follow-up questions for clarity
- Request specific examples for vague feedback
- Have the LLM rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Add your own insights to the LLM's analysis

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Submit LLM output without reading it
- Accept LLM analysis as absolute truth
- Skip adding your human perspective
- Forget to check for hallucinations

### Making Your Review Most Valuable

**Critical Issues Only** (Must fix before launch):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks
- Breaking bugs
- Fundamental design flaws

**High Priority** (Should fix before launch):
- Significant UX issues
- Documentation gaps
- Code quality concerns
- Missing essential features

**Nice to Have** (Post-launch):
- Minor improvements
- Feature suggestions
- Style preferences

## üìã What Makes Good Feedback?

### ‚úÖ Great Feedback Examples

**Specific and Actionable**:
> "The `/explore` command documentation doesn't explain what happens if the project has no `.git` directory. Should include error handling example."

**Evidence-Based**:
> "Tested the quick start tutorial - failed at step 3 because `jq` wasn't installed. Installation guide should list `jq` as a prerequisite."

**Severity-Rated**:
> "CRITICAL: The safe-commit implementation doesn't prevent force pushes to main branch, only warns. This could cause data loss."

### ‚ùå Less Helpful Feedback

**Too Vague**:
> "The documentation is confusing."
(Better: Which doc? What's confusing? Suggestions?)

**Subjective Without Context**:
> "I don't like the command names."
(Better: Which commands? Why not? Better alternatives?)

**Feature Requests Without Rationale**:
> "You should add Docker support."
(Better: What use case? Why needed? How urgent?)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimates

### By Package Type

| Package | Files | Size | Tokens | LLM Time | Human Review |
|---------|-------|------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Quick Start | 30 | 232KB | 56K | 2-5 min | 10-25 min |
| Documentation | 26 | 318KB | 91K | 3-7 min | 30-60 min |
| Developer | 74 | 745KB | 210K | 5-10 min | 1-3 hours |
| Product/UX | 56 | 550KB | 147K | 5-8 min | 1-2 hours |

**Total Time = LLM Analysis Time + Human Review Time**

Example: Quick Start review = 5 min (LLM) + 20 min (review output) = **25 min total**
