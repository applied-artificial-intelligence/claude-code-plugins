# AI/ML Engineering Skills

**3 comprehensive skills for AI/ML engineering workflows**
**Created:** 2025-10-25
**Maintained by:** Applied Artificial Intelligence

---

## Overview

This collection provides deep, specialized expertise for AI/ML engineering tasks. These skills complement the Claude Code plugin framework by adding technology-specific knowledge that activates only when relevant.

**Key Principle**: Skills provide **specialized expertise** for **specific technologies**, not general workflows. They activate automatically when Claude detects relevant context.

## How Skills Work

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a two-tier loading system:

**Tier 1 - Startup** (Lightweight):
```markdown
# RAG Implementation Patterns

Comprehensive guide to implementing RAG systems...
Use when building RAG systems, implementing semantic search...
```
Only the skill description (first paragraph) is loaded at startup. Claude reads all skill metadata to know when each should be used.

**Tier 2 - Runtime** (Full Knowledge):
When Claude detects a RAG-related task, the full skill content loads (~42KB of deep expertise).

**Token Efficiency**:
- Startup: ~100 tokens per skill (300 tokens total for all 3)
- Runtime: ~8-12KB per skill (only when activated)
- Benefit: Unlimited expertise without context penalty

### Automatic Discovery

Skills activate automatically based on context detection:

```python
# User asks:
"/workflow:explore 'Build RAG system for docs'"

# Claude detects keywords:
# - "RAG"
# - "vector database"
# - "semantic search"

# Skill auto-loads:
# → rag-implementation skill activates
# → Provides vector DB selection guide
# → Suggests chunking strategies
# → Includes production patterns

# Result: Expert RAG architecture, not basic tutorial
```

---

## Integration with Plugins

### Workflow Enhancement

**Without Skill** (Plugin alone):
```bash
/workflow:plan "RAG system for customer support"

# Plugin creates standard workflow:
1. Research RAG approaches
2. Choose vector database
3. Implement chunking
4. Build retrieval
5. Create API

# Generic, lacks depth
```

**With Skill** (Plugin + Skill synergy):
```bash
/workflow:plan "RAG system for customer support"

# Plugin workflow executes
# RAG skill auto-loads during planning
# → Recommends Qdrant (self-hosted, production-ready)
# → Suggests semantic chunking (better for support docs)
# → Proposes hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
# → Includes citation tracking (critical for support)

# Generated plan:
1. Setup Qdrant with Docker (specific commands)
2. Implement semantic chunking pipeline (code examples)
3. Generate embeddings with text-embedding-3-small (cost/quality balance)
4. Build hybrid search API (sparse + dense)
5. Add citation system (track sources)
6. Create evaluation framework (measure accuracy)

# Production-grade, specific, actionable
```

### Command-Skill Mapping

## Why These Skills?

### 1. Technology-Specific (Not General)

❌ **Bad**: "Testing patterns" (too broad, should be in agent)
✅ **Good**: "LLM Evaluation" (specific to LLM apps)

❌ **Bad**: "Database optimization" (too general)
✅ **Good**: "RAG Implementation" (specific to vector DBs)

### 2. Subset of Use Cases (Not Always Needed)

Skills only activate when that specific technology is detected:
- RAG skill: Only for RAG/semantic search (not all AI work)
- Transformers skill: Only for Hugging Face code (not TensorFlow, JAX)
- Evaluation skill: Only for LLM testing (not traditional ML)

### 3. On-Brand (AI/ML Focus)

Aligns with Applied AI's domain expertise:
- RAG: Cutting-edge production AI pattern
- Transformers: Most popular ML framework
- LLM Evaluation: Emerging critical need

### 4. First-to-Market

**None of these skills exist on claudeskills.info yet!** This showcases:
- Thought leadership in AI/ML engineering
- Deep domain expertise
- Understanding of real production needs

4. **Iterate based on output** - Skills adapt to your specific use case

### For Skill Developers

1. **Be technology-specific** - Target specific frameworks/tools
2. **Include decision trees** - Help users choose between options
3. **Provide working code** - Real examples, not pseudocode
